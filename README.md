# Q&A with RAG

This jupyter notebook is an example using Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG, to create a simple q&a system that can answer questions about a given PDF.

Tools used: Open AI Embeddings API, Langchain PyPDFLoader, ChromaDB (to store embeddings).

In this example, I built a q&a system that can answer questions based on my resume. Questions like "is hasan a capable sales engineer?".
